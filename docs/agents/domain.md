# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when
exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one
  `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In
  multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped
  decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their
absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill
creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
|-- CONTEXT.md
|-- docs/adr/
|   |-- 0001-example-decision.md
|   `-- 0002-example-decision.md
`-- src/
```

Multi-context repo:

```
/
|-- CONTEXT-MAP.md
|-- docs/adr/
`-- src/
    |-- first-context/
    |   |-- CONTEXT.md
    |   `-- docs/adr/
    `-- second-context/
        |-- CONTEXT.md
        `-- docs/adr/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal,
a hypothesis, or a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't
drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, either you're inventing
language the project doesn't use or there's a real gap to capture with
`/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than
silently overriding it.
